This is a core story behind how I started contributing to the AWS Community in 2024 with a few supporters and learners. Gradually, grew into a impact creating community of students. 
* Students themselves started joining the club
* Started attending different AWS Community programs like ACDs, SCDs and meetups
* Started getting a huge response for AWS Hackathons, competitions, learning programs and certifications
* Most close to my heart: These efforts inspired young girl students to step-in and take ownership and coming ahead, taking initiatives, owning leadership, they started believing on their own leadership, their own strength.
